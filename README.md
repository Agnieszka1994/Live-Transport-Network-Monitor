# Live Transport Network Monitor
The London Transport Company wants to optimize the passenger load on their Underground lines at peak times.

They want ot test a new itineary option for users called `quiet route`. The company can show this option to the users of services like Google Maps, wchich connect to the LTC infrastructure to get travel recommendations.

`A quiet route is a route that may not be the fastest but is noticeably less crowded than other options.`

The London Transport Company hopes that passengers will follow these quiet route suggestions and spread out more evenly acress different lines, especially at peak times when the network is under heavier load.
